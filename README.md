# Subnets

Subnets are a layer-2 scaling solution in the Stacks blockchain that offers low latency and high throughput workloads. It enables developers to build fast and reliable experiences on Stacks.

## Overview

Subnets are designed to transact on Stacks assets, meaning users can move assets in and out of subnets. While a user’s assets are in a subnet, they trust that subnet’s consensus rules. This subnet will interact with the Stacks chain using a smart contract specific to that subnet.

> **_NOTE:_**
> 
> The current implementation of subnets uses a 2-phase commit protocol amongst a fully-trusted pool of miners.

Below are some of the features of subnets:

- Each subnet may define its throughput settings. The default implementation should support at least 4x high throughput for transactions and may reduce confirmation time from 10 minutes to 1 minute.
- Interacting with a subnet is similar to interacting with a different Stacks network (example: testnet vs. mainnet).
- The Stacks blockchain can support many different subnets.
- Each subnet may use the same or different consensus rules.
- This repository implements a consensus mechanism that uses a two-phase commit among a federated pool of miners.
- To deposit into a subnet, users submit a layer-1 transaction to invoke the deposit method on that subnet's smart contract.
- For withdrawals, users commit the withdrawal on the subnet and then submit a layer-1 transaction to invoke the subnet's smart contract's withdraw method.

## Architecture

This diagram outlines the interaction between a subnet and the Stacks layer-1 chain.

![Architecture of subnets.](/docs/images/subnets-architecture.png)

When a miner proposes a block to the other miners, the other miners must approve and sign the block before it can be committed to the subnet.

### Trust models in subnets

The current implementation of subnets uses a federated system of miners. This federation is fully-trusted, but future work on subnets will explore alternative trust models.

In a fully - trusted model:

- Miners are responsible for issuing subnet blocks.
- Users can validate, but subnet miners control withdrawals.
- Trust can be federated with a 2-phase commit and BFT protocol for miner block issuance.
- Federation requires a majority of miners to approve withdrawals.


## Getting Started

Subnets can be built using any of the following methods:
- Build with Clarinet
- Build with Testnet
- Test Locally

> **_NOTE:_**
>
> Subnets were referred to as Hyperchains. While we are in the process of updating the content, you might still see subnets being referred to as Hyperchains.

## Build with Clarinet

Make sure you have `clarinet` installed locally, and that it is at version 0.33.0 or above.
If you do not have clarinet, you can find installation instructions [here](https://github.com/hirosystems/clarinet).

Let's create a new clarinet project. This will create a new directory with a Clarinet project initialized.
```
clarinet new nft-use-case 
```

Let us copy contract files and scripts over from the `stacks-hyperchains` repository into the `nft-use-case` directory. 
If you don't already have the stacks-subnets repository, you can [clone it](https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-subnets).
Here's the command to clone the stacks-hyperchains repository:
```
git clone https://github.com/hirosystems/stacks-hyperchains.git
```
Set the environment variable `HYPERCHAIN_PATH` to the location of the stacks-hyperchains repository on your computer. 
```
export HYPERCHAIN_PATH=<YOUR_PATH_HERE>
```

Now, we can copy files from the stacks-hyperchains repository. These files are contracts that define the layer-1 and layer-2 Clarity traits for NFTs and fungible tokens, implement an NFT in layer-1 and layer-2, and some NodeJS scripts for helping to deploy the contracts.
```
mkdir nft-use-case/contracts-l2
mkdir nft-use-case/scripts
cp $HYPERCHAIN_PATH/core-contracts/contracts/helper/simple-nft.clar nft-use-case/contracts/
cp $HYPERCHAIN_PATH/core-contracts/contracts/helper/trait-standards.clar nft-use-case/contracts/
cp $HYPERCHAIN_PATH/core-contracts/contracts/helper/simple-nft-l2.clar nft-use-case/contracts-l2/
cp $HYPERCHAIN_PATH/core-contracts/contracts/helper/trait-standards.clar nft-use-case/contracts-l2/
cp $HYPERCHAIN_PATH/contrib/scripts/nft-use-case/* nft-use-case/scripts/
cd nft-use-case/scripts
```

To use the scripts in this demo, we need to install some NodeJS libraries. 
Before running the following instructions, make sure you have [node](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed. 
```
npm install
```

The `Devnet.toml` file in the `nft-use-case` directory is responsible for configuring the `clarinet integrate` 
local network. Make the following change in `settings/Devnet.toml` to enable the hyperchain:
```
[devnet]
...
enable_hyperchain_node = true
```

Let's spin up a hyperchain node. Before you call this, make sure that you have a working installation of Docker running 
locally.

```
clarinet integrate
```

Before we publish any transactions, you will need to set up some environment variables.
These environment variables contain the address and private key of the hyperchain miner, two user addresses 
and private keys, and the RPC URL which we can query for hyperchain state.
Open a separate terminal window, navigate to the directory `nft-use-case/scripts`, and enter the following. 
```
export AUTH_HC_MINER_ADDR=ST3AM1A56AK2C1XAFJ4115ZSV26EB49BVQ10MGCS0
export AUTH_HC_MINER_KEY=7036b29cb5e235e5fd9b09ae3e8eec4404e44906814d5d01cbca968a60ed4bfb01

export USER_ADDR=ST2NEB84ASENDXKYGJPQW86YXQCEFEX2ZQPG87ND
export USER_KEY=f9d7206a47f14d2870c163ebab4bf3e70d18f5d14ce1031f3902fbbc894fe4c701

export ALT_USER_ADDR=ST2REHHS5J3CERCRBEPMGH7921Q6PYKAADT7JP2VB
export ALT_USER_KEY=3eccc5dac8056590432db6a35d52b9896876a3d5cbdea53b72400bc9c2099fe801

export HYPERCHAIN_URL="http://localhost:30443"
```

## Build with Testnet

### 1. Getting Testnet STX

```bash
./target/debug/blockstack-cli generate-sk --testnet
{ 
  "publicKey": "02c3c7ab279c5637ea5f024f8036c5218b6d1e71518adba0693c3dcc7bead92305",
  "stacksAddress": "STFTX3F4XCY7RS5VRHXP2SED0WC0YRKNWTNXD74P"
}
```

```bash
curl -X POST "https://stacks-node-api.testnet.stacks.co/extended/v1/faucets/stx?address=STFTX3F4XCY7RS5VRHXP2SED0WC0YRKNWTNXD74P&stacking=true"
```

### 2. Spin up testnet `stacks-node`


```toml
[node]
working_dir = "/var/testnet-stacks-node"
rpc_bind = "127.0.0.1:20443"
p2p_bind = "0.0.0.0:20444"
bootstrap_node = "047435c194e9b01b3d7f7a2802d6684a3af68d05bbf4ec8f17021980d777691f1d51651f7f1d566532c804da506c117bbf79ad62eea81213ba58f8808b4d9504ad@testnet.stacks.co:20444"

[burnchain]
chain = "bitcoin"
mode = "xenon"
peer_host = "bitcoind.testnet.stacks.co"
username = "blockstack"
password = "blockstacksystem"
rpc_port = 18332
peer_port = 18333

# Used for sending events to a local stacks-blockchain-api service
# [[events_observer]]
# endpoint = "localhost:3700"
# retry_count = 255
# events_keys = ["*"]

[[ustx_balance]]
address = "ST2QKZ4FKHAH1NQKYKYAYZPY440FEPK7GZ1R5HBP2"
amount = 10000000000000000

[[ustx_balance]]
address = "ST319CF5WV77KYR1H3GT0GZ7B8Q4AQPY42ETP1VPF"
amount = 10000000000000000

[[ustx_balance]]
address = "ST221Z6TDTC5E0BYR2V624Q2ST6R0Q71T78WTAX6H"
amount = 10000000000000000

[[ustx_balance]]
address = "ST2TFVBMRPS5SSNP98DQKQ5JNB2B6NZM91C4K3P7B"
amount = 10000000000000000
```


```bash
./target/release/stacks-node start --config=/var/devel/stacks-hyperchains/contrib/conf/stacks-l1-testnet.toml 2>&1 | tee -i /tmp/stacks-testnet-0426-1055.log
```

Note: You can use an existing testnet chain state if you have one available.
I used `cp /root/stacks-node/` on one of the Hiro deployed xenon followers.
The first bootup did not work: I `CTRL-C`'d the execution, which triggered a panic,
but on the next start, the node booted fine.

### 3. Launch the contract

Collect the contracts:

```bash
mkdir my-hyperchain/
mkdir my-hyperchain/contracts
cp stacks-hyperchains/core-contracts/contracts/hyperchains.clar my-hyperchain/contracts/
cp stacks-hyperchains/core-contracts/contracts/helper/trait-standards.clar my-hyperchain/contracts/
```

Set the miners list to contain the address generated in Step 1:

```bash
sed -ie "s#^(define-constant miners.*#(define-constant miners (list \'STFTX3F4XCY7RS5VRHXP2SED0WC0YRKNWTNXD74P))#" my-hyperchain/contracts/hyperchains.clar
```

Make the transactions -- you will need to set the private key of the contract publisher as an env var:

```bash
export CONTRACT_PUBLISH_KEY=<PRIVATEKEY>
```

This is the private key from the first step.

```bash
mkdir my-hyperchain/scripts
cp stacks-hyperchains/contrib/scripts/* my-hyperchain/scripts/
cd my-hyperchain/scripts/
npm i @stacks/network
npm i @stacks/transactions
mkdir ../transactions/
node ./publish_tx.js trait-standards ../contracts/trait-standards.clar 0 > ../transactions/trait-publish.hex
node ./publish_tx.js hc-alpha ../contracts/hyperchains.clar 1 > ../transactions/hc-publish.hex
```

Submit the transactions:

```bash
$ node ./broadcast_tx.js ../transactions/trait-publish.hex
{
  txid: '93cae889b9382c512e55715e5357b388734c0448643e2cc35d2a1aab90dcf61a'
}

$ node ./broadcast_tx.js ../transactions/hc-publish.hex
{
  txid: '8c457091916a7f57b487162e0692c2cd28e71dd0b2dc9a9dfad73f93babe1dfd'
}
```

### 4. Configure the HC miner

Create a `toml` configuration for the hyperchains miner.  Importantly,
you should set the `contract_identifier` to the contract published in
Steps 3 (e.g., `STFTX3F4XCY7RS5VRHXP2SED0WC0YRKNWTNXD74P.hc-alpha`).

```toml
[node]
working_dir = "/var/my-hyperchain/hc-alpha"
rpc_bind = "127.0.0.1:80443"
p2p_bind = "127.0.0.1:80444"
mining_key = "<FILL HERE>"
miner = true
wait_time_for_microblocks = 50_000

[miner]
first_attempt_time_ms = 60_000
subsequent_attempt_time_ms = 60_000
microblock_attempt_time_ms = 30_000

[burnchain]
chain = "stacks_layer_1"
mode = "xenon"
first_burn_header_height = 46_721
first_burn_header_hash = "9ba2f357115308fb1c503715f3a1b0cb3e8fdbe6baea7e7634635affdf675501"
contract_identifier = "<CONTRACT_NAME_HERE>"
peer_host = "127.0.0.1"
rpc_port = 20443
peer_port = 20444
rpc_ssl = false

[[ustx_balance]]
address = "STFTX3F4XCY7RS5VRHXP2SED0WC0YRKNWTNXD74P"
amount = 10000000000000000
```

Add to L1 node config:
```
[[events_observer]]
endpoint = "localhost:50303"
retry_count = 255
events_keys = ["*"]
```

### 5. Start the nodes

The `hyperchain-node` must be started before the `stacks-node`:

```bash
./target/release/hyperchain-node start --config=/var/my-hyperchain/configs/hc-miner.toml 2>&1 | tee /var/my-hyperchain/hc-miner.log
```

The `stacks-node` must be started from a state _before_ the
`first_burn_header_height` and `first_burn_header_hash` configured
in the hyperchain node's TOML.

```bash
./target/release/stacks-node start --config=/var/stacks-hyperchains/contrib/conf/stacks-l1-testnet.toml 2>&1 | tee -i /tmp/stacks-testnet.log
```

## Test Locally

### 1. Start the hyperchain miner

```bash
hyperchain-node start --config=$STACKS_HYPERCHAINS_PATH/contrib/conf/hyperchain-l2.toml 2>&1 | tee -i /tmp/stacks-hc.log
```

### 2. Start a local Stacks network

```bash
stacks-node start --config=$STACKS_HYPERCHAINS_PATH/contrib/conf/stacks-l1-mocknet-local.toml 2>&1 | tee -i /tmp/stacks-mocknet.log
```

### 3. Launch the contract

Collect the contracts:

```bash
mkdir my-hyperchain/
mkdir my-hyperchain/contracts
cp stacks-hyperchains/core-contracts/contracts/hyperchains.clar my-hyperchain/contracts/
cp stacks-hyperchains/core-contracts/contracts/helper/ft-trait-standard.clar my-hyperchain/contracts/
cp stacks-hyperchains/core-contracts/contracts/helper/nft-trait-standard.clar my-hyperchain/contracts/
```

Set the miners list to contain the address generated in Step 1:

```bash
sed -ie "s#^(define-data-var miner (optional principal) none)#(define-data-var miner (optional principal) (some \'ST2GE6HSXT81X9X3ATQ14WPT49X915R8X7FVERMBP))#" my-hyperchain/contracts/hyperchains.clar
```

Make the transactions -- you will need to set the private key of the contract publisher as an env var:

```bash
export CONTRACT_PUBLISH_KEY=0916e2eb04b5702e0e946081829cee67d3bb76e1792af506646843db9252ff4101
```

This is the private key from the first step.

```bash
mkdir my-hyperchain/scripts
cp stacks-hyperchains/contrib/scripts/* my-hyperchain/scripts/
cd my-hyperchain/scripts/
npm i @stacks/network
npm i @stacks/transactions
mkdir ../transactions/
node ./publish_tx.js ft-trait-standard ../contracts/ft-trait-standard.clar 0 > ../transactions/ft-publish.hex
node ./publish_tx.js nft-trait-standard ../contracts/nft-trait-standard.clar 1 > ../transactions/nft-publish.hex
node ./publish_tx.js hyperchain ../contracts/hyperchains.clar 2 > ../transactions/hc-publish.hex
```

Submit the transactions:

```bash
for I in `ls ../transactions/`; do node ./broadcast_tx.js "../transactions/$I" http://localhost:20443; done
```

### 4. Deposit some funds to L2

```js
const network = require('@stacks/network');
const transactions = require('@stacks/transactions');
const senderKey = "aaf57b4730f713cf942bc63f0801c4a62abe5a6ac8e3da10389f9ca3420b0dc701"
const layer1 = new network.StacksTestnet();
layer1.coreApiUrl = "http://localhost:20443";

const depositTransaction = await transactions.makeContractCall({
   senderKey, network: layer1, anchorMode: transactions.AnchorMode.Any,
   nonce: 0,
   contractAddress: "ST2GE6HSXT81X9X3ATQ14WPT49X915R8X7FVERMBP",
   contractName: "hyperchain",
   functionName: "deposit-stx",
   functionArgs: [ transactions.uintCV(100000000000),
                   transactions.standardPrincipalCV("ST18F1AHKW194BWQ3CEFDPWVRARA79RBGFEWSDQR8")],
   fee: 10000,
   postConditionMode: transactions.PostConditionMode.Allow,
});

const depositTxid = await transactions.broadcastTransaction(depositTransaction, layer1);
```

Check that you received the funds in L2:

```js
const layer2 = new network.StacksTestnet();
layer2.coreApiUrl = "http://localhost:19443";
await fetch(layer2.getAccountApiUrl("ST18F1AHKW194BWQ3CEFDPWVRARA79RBGFEWSDQR8")).then(x => x.json()).then(x => parseInt(x.balance));
```

### 5. Submit an L2 transaction


```js
const codeBody = "(define-public (stx-withdraw (amount uint)) (stx-withdraw? amount tx-sender))";
const contractName = "withdraw-helper";
const deployWithdrawal = await transactions.makeContractDeploy({
    codeBody, contractName, senderKey, network: layer2,
    anchorMode: transactions.AnchorMode.Any, nonce: 0,
    fee: 10000,
  });
  
await transactions.broadcastTransaction(deployWithdrawal, layer2);
```


### 6. Withdraw

Perform the withdrawal on layer-2

```js
const withdrawTransaction = await transactions.makeContractCall({
   senderKey, network: layer2, anchorMode: transactions.AnchorMode.Any,
   nonce: 1,
   contractAddress: "ST18F1AHKW194BWQ3CEFDPWVRARA79RBGFEWSDQR8",
   contractName: "withdraw-helper",
   functionName: "stx-withdraw",
   functionArgs: [ transactions.uintCV(50000) ],
   fee: 10000,
   postConditionMode: transactions.PostConditionMode.Allow,
});

await transactions.broadcastTransaction(withdrawTransaction, layer2);
```

Find the withdrawal event in our log:

```bash
cat /tmp/stacks-hc.log | grep "Parsed L2"
```

Perform the withdrawal on layer-1

```js
let withdrawUrl = "http://localhost:19443/v2/withdrawal/stx/14/ST18F1AHKW194BWQ3CEFDPWVRARA79RBGFEWSDQR8/0/50000";
let json_merkle_entry = await fetch(withdrawUrl).then(x => x.json())
let cv_merkle_entry = {
    withdrawal_leaf_hash: transactions.deserializeCV(json_merkle_entry.withdrawal_leaf_hash),
    withdrawal_root: transactions.deserializeCV(json_merkle_entry.withdrawal_root),
    sibling_hashes: transactions.deserializeCV(json_merkle_entry.sibling_hashes),
};

const layer1WithdrawTransaction = await transactions.makeContractCall({
   senderKey, network: layer1, anchorMode: transactions.AnchorMode.Any,
   nonce: 1,
   contractAddress: "ST2GE6HSXT81X9X3ATQ14WPT49X915R8X7FVERMBP",
   contractName: "hyperchain",
   functionName: "withdraw-stx",
   functionArgs: [ transactions.uintCV(50000),
                   transactions.standardPrincipalCV("ST18F1AHKW194BWQ3CEFDPWVRARA79RBGFEWSDQR8"),
                   cv_merkle_entry.withdrawal_root,
                   cv_merkle_entry.withdrawal_leaf_hash,
                   cv_merkle_entry.sibling_hashes ],
   fee: 5000,
   postConditionMode: transactions.PostConditionMode.Allow,
});

await transactions.broadcastTransaction(layer1WithdrawTransaction, layer1)
;
```

## Run Tests

In your terminal, you can run tests by navigating to the `testnet/stacks-node/` directory and run the following command:

`testnet/stacks-node$ cargo test`

If you want to ignore some tests, you can use the following command:

`testnet/stacks-node$ cargo test -- --ignored --num-threads=1`
