title: How to Register NFT asset
---

Create the transaction to register the new NFT asset we just published. This must be called by a miner of the hyperchains contract.
Specifically, this transaction will be sent by `AUTH_HC_MINER_ADDR`. 
```
node ./register_nft.js 0
```
Look for the following transaction confirmation in the Clarinet console in an upcoming block on the layer 1.
